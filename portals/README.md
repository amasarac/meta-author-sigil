## ðŸŒ€ MASL Portal Codex

Each portal represents a **facet of the lattice**:

- **Portal I â€” Resonant Harmonic**: Harmonic entrainment and frequency weaving.  
- **Portal II â€” Holonic Reflection**: Recursive scrying through holons and lenses.  
- **Portal III â€” Spectral Algebra**: Eigenmodes, resonance markers, algebraic light.  
- **Portal IV â€” Atlas Meta-Mirror**: Fractal codex mapping of knowledge lattices.  
- **Portal V â€” Fortress Veil**: Quantum shroud, breach control, dimensional lockdown.  
- **The Great Weaving**: Threads of glyphs woven into living lattice.  
- **Cognitive Glass Player**: Lexeme tones reflected through harmonic playback.  
- **Lexeme Tone Mapper**: Mapping lexemes to tonal correspondences.  
- **New Atlas Map**: Spiral glyphode cartography.  
- **Manifold Sigil Viewer**: Blooming dodecagram and manifold echoes.  
- **Fortress of Syn-Cog**: Central stronghold of the lattice.
