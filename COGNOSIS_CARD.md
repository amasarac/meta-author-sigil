# CoGnosis — Convergent Knowing

**Concept:** CoGnosis  
**Protocol:** CoGnosis Pass (Observe → Reflect → Attune → Act → Integrate)  
**Ritual:** CoGnosis Breath (4–6–8 spiral • x3 rounds)

### Purpose
Fuse analytic cognition with direct gnosis to produce actionably *felt* insight.

### The Pass (ORIAI)
1) **Observe** (signal ingress)  
2) **Reflect** (mirror & context)  
3) **Attune** (somatic + symbolic alignment)  
4) **Act** (minimal viable intervention)  
5) **Integrate** (write-back to Cognition Map)

### Breath Cue
Inhale 4 • hold 6 • exhale 8 — three rounds while tracing the spiral.
